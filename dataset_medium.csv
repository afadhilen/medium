"" with the  engineering procurement and construction contractors ge and equipment  suppliers bechtel too in a cautious mode mode , dpc was finding it even more  difficult to continue the construction of the project as per the schedules .  sources said the stand taken by the rest of the directors on the board would  be in view of the backlash that the company would have to face from its  shareholders if the project actually flopped . enron had similar bitter  experiences in pakistan and it was difficult for the parent company to then  justify such investments to the shareholders .  enron , which had planned a major investments in india ' s infrastructure  sectors such as oil and gas , lng , gas transportation , telecom and broadband  network , has already pulled out most of their personnel from some of these  operations . the company ' s mous with various other majors like indian oil  corporation , too , is in a limbo and the us major ' s stake in the oil and gas  venture is up for grabs . however , even though lay is still hoping to find a  solution to the controversy back home , both dpc and mseb are still to get  down to negotiations .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  the economic times , may 7 , 2001  maha sore over delay in naming godbole nominee  the maharashtra government has expressed ' unhappiness ' over the centre ' s  delay in appointing its nominee on the nine - member godbole committee to  renegotiate the power purchase agreement signed between enron - promoted  dabhol power company and state electricity board .

"" let ntpc and power trading corporation of india ( ptc ) come  together and sell dpc ' s surlpus power . we have already mooted this  suggestion , but a favourable reply is yet to come from the union power  ministry , "" the official said . the official said that the centre , which was  also responsible for dpc project as it has provided counter guarantee to  enron india , should form a special purpose vehicle for sale of the excess  power to other states . the state government ' s reaction comes in wake of union  power minister suresh prabhu ' s discussion with chief minister vilasrao  deshmukh in delhi few days ago . it was learnt that prabhu told deshmukh  "" there is no question of ntpc buying power from the project since long term  ppas have been signed by ntpc with the buying states "" .  deshmukh had suggested that the central power utility should sell excess  power over and above the 300 - 400 mw needed for the state from the dpc ' s 740  mw phase - i and soon to be commissioned phase - ii of 1 , 444 mw , to other needy  states . considering the high cost of power generated from dpc , which during  the recent months has hovered around rs 7 per unit as against an average cost  of rs 2 . 30 - 2 . 80 a unit from central and state utilities , there would be few  takers for the power from dabhol , the power minister reportedly said .  "" deficit states will buy dpc power only when the cost of power is brought  down , "" he said , adding power ministry would facilitate wheelng of this power  to the buyers .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  business standard , monday , 7 may 2001  reliance allowed to hawk power from patalganga to third parties  arijit de , s ravindran & renni abraham in mumbai  in an unusual departure from normal practice , the maharashtra government has  allowed the reliance group to sell power generated by its 447 - mw patalganga  power project directly to third parties if the maharashtra state  electricity board ( mseb ) does not lift power . the project  , s power purchase  agreement ( ppa ) has a clause to this effect . the state government  , s  permission to reliance to hawk power to third parties has to be seen in the  context of its dithering on forwarding to the centre the dabhol power  company  , s bid for mega power status so that it could sell power to third  parties .  dpc sources told business standard several weeks ago that the company  , s  application had been pending with the chief minister  , s office for months .  only now has the state government authorised the godbole committee to  negotiate with dpc on third party sales outside the state . the dpc project  is facing the threat of closure following mseb  , s inability to buy power from  it , thanks to the board  , s weak financial position . not only can the  reliance group sell power to third parties within maharashtra , but it can  sell power to utilities outside the state . the ppa does not expressly bar it  from doing so . nor does it specify the category of customers to whom power  can be sold . so , in effect , this suggests that the group could sell power to  industrial and commercial customers in maharashtra and emerge as a rival to  the mseb . the state electricity board derives over 80 per cent of its revenue  from such consumers .  apart from captive power plants , independent power producers in india are  allowed to sell power only to state electricity boards . they can sell power  outside the state only if they qualify for mega power project status . with  its 447 - mw capacity , the patalganga project is not eligible for such status  because mega power rojects are supposed to have a minimum capacity of 1 , 000  mw . speaking on the sidelines of a press conference last week , reliance  industries managing director anil ambani told business standard : a provision  in third parties . ambani was answering a question on whether the mseb  , s weak  financials and inability to offer escrow cover to the project as emphasised  in the godbole committee report set up to defuse the dabhol crisis would  derail the patalganga project .  the ppa does not have any express restriction as to third party sale outside  the state , a reliance spokesperson confirmed on friday in a faxed response  to questions . a senior mseb official explained that the state government  cleared private power projects some years ago on the basis of the  unrealistically high demand projections contained in a report by a former  mseb official . subsequently , it was realised that the state would be stuck  with excess power . so the reliance group was permitted to sell power to third  parties , he said . the patalganga project along with the ispat group  , s 1 , 082  mw bhadravati project has been put on hold till the godbole committee submits  its second  report .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  the economic times , may 7 , 2001  no need of patalganga , bhadravati power : mseb  the axe seems to have finally fallen on the much - delayed reliance  industries - promoted patalganga and ispat industries ' bhadravati power  projects in maharashtra as the state electricity board has firmly told the  government that "" there is no need of these projects nor their power "" . the  loss - making board has communicated to the government that mseb had "" no  interest "" in patalganga and bhadravati , as it did not have escrow - able  capacity and also that industrial demand for power had slowed down  tremendously in maharashtra , state government sources said here on sunday .  "" in last november itself , mseb had sent an official intimation to the state  government informing its decision in favour of cancellation of the two  projects on several grounds - - including they being unviable and  unaffordable , "" sources said . "" reliance ' s project is no different from that of  dpc ' s . patalganga is also naphtha - based and its ppa is on similar lines . . .  after the enron experience , mseb cannot even dream of another gas - based  power plant in the state , "" a senior mseb official said . he said mseb has  already asked the state government not to provide escrow to both the 447 - mw  patalganga and the 1 , 084 - mw coal - based bhadravati , "" as the us energy major  has almost squeezed us of all over finances "" . when contacted , mseb chairman  vinay bansal said : "" reliance and ispat projects have been put on hold as per  the godbole committee ' s recommendations "" , but expressed inability to give  further details .  currently , bhadravati and patalganga projects have been put on hold as per  godbole committee report , which was set up to review the dpc - mseb ppa and  energy scenario in maharashtra . "" can you go ahead with the project without an  escrow cover ? "" the committee was believed to have asked ispat and reliance  representatives , to which the reply had been negative , sources added .  sources said , as of now , both the projects have not been able to achieve  financial closure as leading financial institutions were not willing to  fund the projects which do not have a "" guaranteed payment "" mechanism from  mseb , which , incidentally it has promised to dpc . "" all the three were cleared  as ' fast - track ' projects , but other than enron , reliance and ispat have been  caught in a quagmire , especially bhadravati , which has been hanging afire  since last nine years , "" they added .  moreover , the mseb official opined that given the current situation , if dpc  calls it quits from india , bhadravati was a safer bet than reliance ' s  patalganga . patalganga ' s power would be mere 50 paise less than that of dpc ' s  that ranges anywhere around approximately rs 4 . 50 per unit to as high as rs  7 , while bhadravati ' s cost could be around rs 3 . 80 to rs 4 per unit , he  informed . mseb ' s installed capacity ended on march 31 , 2001 , wasl 4 , 000 mw and  it has generated 45 , 000 million units with transmission and distribution  losses as high as 39 per cent .

"" we hauled less freight in february than february a year ago , "" said bob  hammel , executive vice president of pittsburgh - based pitt ohio express , a  leading privately held eastern regional ltl carrier . "" the slowdown in  manufacturing began in the middle of last year and it was precipitous . nobody  anticipated the speed in which manufacturing demand fell off . ""  even con - way , the most profitable ltl operation in the past five years , said  it would have a decline in first - quarter operating income compared with the  year - ago period . con - way ' s tonnage declines were estimated in the  "" mid - single - digit "" percentage range .  roadway express estimated that its current tonnage levels are running 10 to  11 percent below those a year ago , which will result in an approximately  one - half of 1 percent ( 0 . 5 percent ) decline in its operating ratio . ( see  sidebar )  pat hanley , overnite transportation ' s senior vice president and chief  financial officer , said freight figures were flat in february year over year  but rose slightly in march . overnite is the exception to the ltl industry  with as many as 24 new terminals scheduled to be opened this year .  "" january was pretty good to us , but february was flat . it ' s coming back in  march . we ' re probably up in low single digits , 3 to 4 percent . we ' re picking  back up . the economy has hurt us . if you had asked us at the start of the  year , we ' d have said we ' d be up double - digits , "" hanley said .  the national economic picture is "" a big concern , "" hanley said . "" we ' re not  seeing pressure on prices , at least not so far . we ' re seeing customers ship  10 pallets a day instead of 20 . the shipment size is coming down . certainly  we ' re concerned . we ' ll do o . k . , but not as great as we ' d like . ""  forget consumer confidence surveys or the producer pricing index or whatever  stars align in federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan ' s world . the  genuine leading indicator of any national economic trend is trucking , which  is always a first - in , first - out industry in any economic slowdown .  to hear trucking industry leaders tell it , get comfortable with beans and  franks for dinner . it ' s going to be awhile before it ' s filet mignon time  again .  shippers see what ' s happening as well but say it ' s still too early in the  year for carriers to start cutting rates to fill empty trucks .  "" all the carriers we talk with report flat or slightly declining business  levels - - definitely slower than early last year , "" said bill huie , assistant  vice president of corporate transportation for nch corp . , irving , texas .  "" with a couple of exceptions , carriers we talk with have no plans for  expansion in the next few months . we are getting feelers about some possible  lane adjustments to boost revenue . but generally it appears a little early in  the economic downturn for much price movement . ""  the national ltl carriers are seeing the same things . "" our business is down  pretty substantially for the first quarter , "" said roger dick , spokesman for  yellow corp . , parent of yellow freight system and two large regional ltl  carriers , jevic transportation , delanco , n . j . , and saia motor freight ,  duluth , ga .  usfreightways corp . , citing what it called the nation ' s "" serious economic  slowdown , "" said it expects first - quarter earnings to fall "" very substantially  below "" current wall street consensus .  extreme weather conditions also contributed to the already weakened operating  environment , usf chairman , president and ceo samuel k . skinner added .  "" traditionally , the first quarter builds momentum slowly , with march being  the strongest month of the period , "" skinner said in a statement . "" this year ,  the economic slowdown of the fourth quarter of 2000 accelerated in january  and february , softening even the normal modest expectations for those two  months . ""  it ' s not just the ltl industry that ' s hurting . the morgan stanley dean witter  truckload freight index continues to show the worst demand - supply  relationship since analyst james j . valentine began tracking the data in  april 1994 . two events can cause weakness in the index , according to  valentine . they are either an abundance of excess trucks on the road or weak  freight demand .  "" so far in 2001 , we have seen the confluence of both factors , but the  fall - off in demand has far outpaced the increase in supply , "" valentine wrote  in his most recent "" trucking snapshot "" for early march .  year - to - date measurement for truckload demand is down 25 percent year over  year , according to valentine ' s index , while supply is up only 7 percent . that  would indicate the over capacity was a significant issue last year but was  "" masked by the strong economy , "" valentine says .  in a more ominous note , valentine believes overcapacity will continue to  plague the truckload industry for the next one to two years . only a  reaccelerating national economy can bring the demand - supply back in balance  for the truckload sector in the near term , valentine predicts .  the overproduction of new class 8 trucks from early 1998 through early last  year has put too many trucks on the roads and caused supply to back up at  manufacturers , wholesalers and other retailers . used trucks have lost on  average more than 30 percent of their value over the past 18 months .  anecdotally , one used truck dealer , music city truck & equipment , in  lavergne , tenn . , is holding a "" two - for - one "" sale on three - to five - year - old  class 8 freightliners . you can buy two for around $ 30 , 000 , less than a brand  new chevy suburban suv .  what that means is a trucker who bought a 1998 class 8 truck for $ 70 , 000 and  depreciated half the value over three years has a piece of equipment on the  books this year at $ 35 , 000 . but assuming it has lost 30 percent of that  value , it may only be worth $ 24 , 500 in actuality . for a carrier with a  100 - truck fleet , that equates to a loss of more than $ 1 million on assets .  the glut may last for a while , according to valentine ' s analysis . assuming a  three - year trade - in cycle , most of the class 8 tractors in the truckload  sector are just now rolling over to the used - truck market . that means that  overcapacity will plague the truckload industry for at least the next year .  that will result in some of the marginal carriers exiting the business , as  did nearly 1 , 900 carriers last year that either closed or declared  bankruptcy .  "" we can see from indexes , surveys and other information available to us that  it is unlikely there will be any significant improvement in march and freight  demands will continue to be soft throughout the month . based on all of these  factors , we expect usfreightways ' profits for the first quarter to be very  substantially less than published analysts ' forecasts , "" skinner said .  in addition , severe weather conditions including an earthquake in seattle ,  rainstorms in california and blizzards in the northeast have added cost and  decreased efficiencies , skinner added .  expectations at each of usf ' s operating companies have been affected , some  more than others . the ltl , logistics , reverse logistics and  freight - forwarding units are all showing decreased revenue and volume over a  similar period last year , skinner said .  further job cuts at usf worldwide , its freight forwarder , would be in the  offing as cost controls at the unit would be "" accelerated "" in the wake of the  softening economy , skinner said . late last year , skinner said the rebuilding  process at usf worldwide would be a two - year process . but the worsening  economy has made that rebuilding job harder , he said .  "" we are seeing evidence that the slowing economy is , in fact , further  impeding progress in this area , "" skinner said . "" during the fourth quarter of  2000 and continuing into the first quarter of 2001 , the company has taken  steps to increase cost efficiencies . among these actions are a substantial  cutback in capital spending and significant reductions in the labor force .  these cost - control efforts will be accelerated to partially counterbalance  the damaging impact of the current economic and weather conditions . ""  in the 2000 first quarter , usf posted $ 22 . 3 million net income , a 27 percent  rise from the $ 17 . 5 million earnings in the 1999 first quarter . at the time ,  that was usf ' s 15 th straight quarter - over - quarter earnings increase . it came  on $ 608 . 2 million revenue , an 18 . 5 percent rise in from the $ 513 . 2 million  revenue in the 1999 first quarter . analysts had been estimating usf to earn  about $ 3 . 50 a share earnings for 2001 , compared with actual $ 3 . 61 earnings  per share for all of last year . in the fourth quarter last year , usf earned  $ 23 . 7 million , or 91 cents a share .  trucking in a snapshot  market what ' s going on  msdw [ * ] truckload remains in record - low territory , indicating  freight index the worst demand - supply relationship since msdw  began tracking the date in april 1994 .  diesel prices diesel prices in the first quarter of 2001  have come down 6 % sequentially from 4 qo 0 . however ,  the average price for the quarter remains 6 %  above that of lqo 0 .  wti oil opec recently agreed to reduce supply by 5 % and  has stated a price objective of $ 25 per barrel .  capacity retail sales of class 8 tractors ( new trucks  entering the market ) came down in january , but  inventory ( trucks that will enter the market at some  point ) to sales ratio hit a new high of 3 . 4 months  gdp 4 qo 0 gdp increased 1 . 1 % and economists see u . s .  recession in 2001 with + 0 . 5 % and - 1 . 4 % gdp forecast  for lqol and 2 qol , respectively .  retail sales retail sales rose 0 . 7 % in january . while this  was better than forecast , the upside was likely  the result of excessive clearance sales after a  disappointing holiday season .  consumer the conference board ' s measure of consumer  confidence confidence fell again ( nine points ) in february  after registering the largest one - month decline  in 10 years in january ( 14 points ) .  napm the february napm rose slightly to 41 . 9 .  however , it still indicates a contracting  manufacturing sector .  leading the index of leading economic indicators  economic rose 0 . 8 % in january , while  indicator msdw had forecast a 0 . 6 % increase . this  represents the first rise in four months .  stock after a recent pullback , trucking stocks remain  perfonnance up year - to - date with tl stocks up 5 % , regional  ltl stocks up 9 % and national ltl stocks up 13 % .  investor for the week ended february 28 , mutual fund  outflows totaled $ 309 million , compared with  inflows of $ 2 billion in the prior week .  market implications  msdw [ * ] truckload negative for all tl carriers .  freight index  diesel prices the downward trend is positive for all  carriers , especially tl carriers , which have  greater exposure to fuel than ltl carriers .  wti oil negative for all carriers , as $ 25 per  barrel is still 25 % higher than the $ 20 per  barrel average since 1990 .  capacity negative for tl carriers , not a major  concern for ltl carriers , which measure  capacity by the number of terminals .  gdp negative for all carriers .  retail sales negative for both ti and ltl carriers .  consumer negative for all carriers  confidence  napm negative for all carriers .  leading positive for all carriers .  economic  indicator  stock positive , however , stocks could pull  perfonnance back further in the short term as  fundamentals catch up .  investor negative .  source : morgan stanley dean witter research",0,"subject: fw : fyi - more on truck s / d  vince :  i ' d like to send you some articles on the fleet card business .  if you have some time , i ' d like to discuss the meeting that we had with  comdata ( which has a 60 % market share of the fleet card business ) . they have  some live data that potentially could be very interesting ; however , i ' d like  to discuss it with you .  shawn  what a mess !

""  even con - way , the most profitable ltl operation in the past five years , said  it would have a decline in first - quarter operating income compared with the  year - ago period . con - way ' s tonnage declines were estimated in the  "" mid - single - digit "" percentage range .  roadway express estimated that its current tonnage levels are running 10 to  11 percent below those a year ago , which will result in an approximately  one - half of 1 percent ( 0 . 5 percent ) decline in its operating ratio . ( see  sidebar )  pat hanley , overnite transportation ' s senior vice president and chief  financial officer , said freight figures were flat in february year over year  but rose slightly in march . overnite is the exception to the ltl industry  with as many as 24 new terminals scheduled to be opened this year .  "" january was pretty good to us , but february was flat . it ' s coming back in  march . we ' re probably up in low single digits , 3 to 4 percent . we ' re picking  back up . the economy has hurt us . if you had asked us at the start of the  year , we ' d have said we ' d be up double - digits , "" hanley said .  the national economic picture is "" a big concern , "" hanley said . "" we ' re not  seeing pressure on prices , at least not so far . we ' re seeing customers ship  10 pallets a day instead of 20 . the shipment size is coming down . certainly  we ' re concerned . we ' ll do o . k . , but not as great as we ' d like . ""  forget consumer confidence surveys or the producer pricing index or whatever  stars align in federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan ' s world . the  genuine leading indicator of any national economic trend is trucking , which  is always a first - in , first - out industry in any economic slowdown .  to hear trucking industry leaders tell it , get comfortable with beans and  franks for dinner . it ' s going to be awhile before it ' s filet mignon time  again .  shippers see what ' s happening as well but say it ' s still too early in the  year for carriers to start cutting rates to fill empty trucks .  "" all the carriers we talk with report flat or slightly declining business  levels - - definitely slower than early last year , "" said bill huie , assistant  vice president of corporate transportation for nch corp . , irving , texas .  "" with a couple of exceptions , carriers we talk with have no plans for  expansion in the next few months . we are getting feelers about some possible  lane adjustments to boost revenue . but generally it appears a little early in  the economic downturn for much price movement . ""  the national ltl carriers are seeing the same things . "" our business is down  pretty substantially for the first quarter , "" said roger dick , spokesman for  yellow corp . , parent of yellow freight system and two large regional ltl  carriers , jevic transportation , delanco , n . j . , and saia motor freight ,  duluth , ga .  usfreightways corp . , citing what it called the nation ' s "" serious economic  slowdown , "" said it expects first - quarter earnings to fall "" very substantially  below "" current wall street consensus .  extreme weather conditions also contributed to the already weakened operating  environment , usf chairman , president and ceo samuel k . skinner added .  "" traditionally , the first quarter builds momentum slowly , with march being  the strongest month of the period , "" skinner said in a statement . "" this year ,  the economic slowdown of the fourth quarter of 2000 accelerated in january  and february , softening even the normal modest expectations for those two  months . ""  it ' s not just the ltl industry that ' s hurting . the morgan stanley dean witter  truckload freight index continues to show the worst demand - supply  relationship since analyst james j . valentine began tracking the data in  april 1994 . two events can cause weakness in the index , according to  valentine . they are either an abundance of excess trucks on the road or weak  freight demand .  "" so far in 2001 , we have seen the confluence of both factors , but the  fall - off in demand has far outpaced the increase in supply , "" valentine wrote  in his most recent "" trucking snapshot "" for early march .  year - to - date measurement for truckload demand is down 25 percent year over  year , according to valentine ' s index , while supply is up only 7 percent . that  would indicate the over capacity was a significant issue last year but was  "" masked by the strong economy , "" valentine says .  in a more ominous note , valentine believes overcapacity will continue to  plague the truckload industry for the next one to two years . only a  reaccelerating national economy can bring the demand - supply back in balance  for the truckload sector in the near term , valentine predicts .  the overproduction of new class 8 trucks from early 1998 through early last  year has put too many trucks on the roads and caused supply to back up at  manufacturers , wholesalers and other retailers . used trucks have lost on  average more than 30 percent of their value over the past 18 months .  anecdotally , one used truck dealer , music city truck & equipment , in  lavergne , tenn . , is holding a "" two - for - one "" sale on three - to five - year - old  class 8 freightliners . you can buy two for around $ 30 , 000 , less than a brand  new chevy suburban suv .  what that means is a trucker who bought a 1998 class 8 truck for $ 70 , 000 and  depreciated half the value over three years has a piece of equipment on the  books this year at $ 35 , 000 . but assuming it has lost 30 percent of that  value , it may only be worth $ 24 , 500 in actuality . for a carrier with a  100 - truck fleet , that equates to a loss of more than $ 1 million on assets .  the glut may last for a while , according to valentine ' s analysis . assuming a  three - year trade - in cycle , most of the class 8 tractors in the truckload  sector are just now rolling over to the used - truck market . that means that  overcapacity will plague the truckload industry for at least the next year .  that will result in some of the marginal carriers exiting the business , as  did nearly 1 , 900 carriers last year that either closed or declared  bankruptcy .  "" we can see from indexes , surveys and other information available to us that  it is unlikely there will be any significant improvement in march and freight  demands will continue to be soft throughout the month . based on all of these  factors , we expect usfreightways ' profits for the first quarter to be very  substantially less than published analysts ' forecasts , "" skinner said .  in addition , severe weather conditions including an earthquake in seattle ,  rainstorms in california and blizzards in the northeast have added cost and  decreased efficiencies , skinner added .  expectations at each of usf ' s operating companies have been affected , some  more than others . the ltl , logistics , reverse logistics and  freight - forwarding units are all showing decreased revenue and volume over a  similar period last year , skinner said .  further job cuts at usf worldwide , its freight forwarder , would be in the  offing as cost controls at the unit would be "" accelerated "" in the wake of the  softening economy , skinner said . late last year , skinner said the rebuilding  process at usf worldwide would be a two - year process . but the worsening  economy has made that rebuilding job harder , he said .  "" we are seeing evidence that the slowing economy is , in fact , further  impeding progress in this area , "" skinner said . "" during the fourth quarter of  2000 and continuing into the first quarter of 2001 , the company has taken  steps to increase cost efficiencies . among these actions are a substantial  cutback in capital spending and significant reductions in the labor force .  these cost - control efforts will be accelerated to partially counterbalance  the damaging impact of the current economic and weather conditions . ""  in the 2000 first quarter , usf posted $ 22 . 3 million net income , a 27 percent  rise from the $ 17 . 5 million earnings in the 1999 first quarter . at the time ,  that was usf ' s 15 th straight quarter - over - quarter earnings increase . it came  on $ 608 . 2 million revenue , an 18 . 5 percent rise in from the $ 513 . 2 million  revenue in the 1999 first quarter . analysts had been estimating usf to earn  about $ 3 . 50 a share earnings for 2001 , compared with actual $ 3 . 61 earnings  per share for all of last year . in the fourth quarter last year , usf earned  $ 23 . 7 million , or 91 cents a share .  trucking in a snapshot  market what ' s going on  msdw [ * ] truckload remains in record - low territory , indicating  freight index the worst demand - supply relationship since msdw  began tracking the date in april 1994 .  diesel prices diesel prices in the first quarter of 2001  have come down 6 % sequentially from 4 qo 0 . however ,  the average price for the quarter remains 6 %  above that of lqo 0 .  wti oil opec recently agreed to reduce supply by 5 % and  has stated a price objective of $ 25 per barrel .  capacity retail sales of class 8 tractors ( new trucks  entering the market ) came down in january , but  inventory ( trucks that will enter the market at some  point ) to sales ratio hit a new high of 3 . 4 months  gdp 4 qo 0 gdp increased 1 . 1 % and economists see u . s .  recession in 2001 with + 0 . 5 % and - 1 . 4 % gdp forecast  for lqol and 2 qol , respectively .  retail sales retail sales rose 0 . 7 % in january . while this  was better than forecast , the upside was likely  the result of excessive clearance sales after a  disappointing holiday season .  consumer the conference board ' s measure of consumer  confidence confidence fell again ( nine points ) in february  after registering the largest one - month decline  in 10 years in january ( 14 points ) .  napm the february napm rose slightly to 41 . 9 .  however , it still indicates a contracting  manufacturing sector .  leading the index of leading economic indicators  economic rose 0 . 8 % in january , while  indicator msdw had forecast a 0 . 6 % increase . this  represents the first rise in four months .  stock after a recent pullback , trucking stocks remain  perfonnance up year - to - date with tl stocks up 5 % , regional  ltl stocks up 9 % and national ltl stocks up 13 % .  investor for the week ended february 28 , mutual fund  outflows totaled $ 309 million , compared with  inflows of $ 2 billion in the prior week .  market implications  msdw [ * ] truckload negative for all tl carriers .  freight index  diesel prices the downward trend is positive for all  carriers , especially tl carriers , which have  greater exposure to fuel than ltl carriers .  wti oil negative for all carriers , as $ 25 per  barrel is still 25 % higher than the $ 20 per  barrel average since 1990 .  capacity negative for tl carriers , not a major  concern for ltl carriers , which measure  capacity by the number of terminals .  gdp negative for all carriers .  retail sales negative for both ti and ltl carriers .  consumer negative for all carriers  confidence  napm negative for all carriers .  leading positive for all carriers .  economic  indicator  stock positive , however , stocks could pull  perfonnance back further in the short term as  fundamentals catch up .  investor negative .  source : morgan stanley dean witter research",0,0

ham,"Subject: preface for book  vince ,  ?  hope you are well .  ?  we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book , and  you kindly offered that you would provide this . ? is this still possible ? ? we  realise that you are extremely busy , so chris and les went ahead and wrote  something , which is below , and if you want to review , change or re - write ? the  preface , that would be very appreciated . ? let me know what your thoughts are .  ?  thanks ,  julie  ( we ' re getting close )  ?  ?  preface  ?  ?  ?  one of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives : pricing and risk  management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for  the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible , to discuss  in - depth the models , and to show how they relate to each other . ? in this  way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models , price a wide  range of energy derivatives , or to build a risk management system which uses  a consistent modelling framework . ? we believe that for practitioners this  last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and  presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving  arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad - hoc and inconsistent  models for different instruments and markets ( see also others who propose  consistent models ? ) . ? however , it is not our wish to concentrate on one  particular model or models , at the exclusion of the others because we  believe that the choice should rest with the user ( although it will probably  be clear from our discussions the model ( s ) we prefer ) . ? we therefore try and  give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all  the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models  which best suit their needs .  ?  in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model  and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book . ?  in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes  modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees  and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing , which are used throughout  the book .  ?  in chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices . ? as well as  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that  can be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of  geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility  and jump processes , discussing each and showing how they can be simulated  and their parameters estimated .  ?  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron corp . , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets . ?  this chapter builds on the previous one . ? it examines in detail the methods ,  merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different  pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and  electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative  aspects of calculating volatility .  ?  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . ? although such  curves are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial  markets , the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well  defined curves . ? in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy  prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments . ? we  outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building  forward curves in energy markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric  approach , and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic  factors .  ?  chapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative  markets and discusses their uses . ? examples of products analysed in this  chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as  energy swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback  options , and ladder options .  ?  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . ? closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the  models in this chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience  yield and interest rate model .  ?  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . ? simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . ? in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . ? this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and  american style options .  ?  chapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve . ? the approach  results in a multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the  evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined  volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . ? closed - form  solutions are developed for pricing standard european options , and efficient  monte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options . ? the chapter  closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options .  ?  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . ?  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the  problem of managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a  portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging  )  illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models . ? the  general model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor  hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed .  ?  chapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value at risk ( var )  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products . ? after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . ? we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma ,  historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same  portfolio of energy options . ? in this chapter we also look at testing the  var estimates for various underlying energy market variables .  ?  finally , in chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we  look in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan  ( 1997 ) ) and creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial products ( 1997 ) ) for which  detailed information is publicly available . ? together these provide an  extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk . ? we present  numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives .  ?  before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this  book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of  how both the  + tool  , and the market works . ?

ham,"Subject: re : hello from vince kaminski at enron  vince ,  thank you for forwarding the following messages . i am sorry that i am just  now getting back to you , my lotus notes was down all afternoon yesterday .  we currently have the cal berkeley general presentation set for wednesday ,  october 18 th at 7 : 00 p . m . which works out well because it is just prior to  the time deadline for students to submit their resumes . the general  presentation is a general overview of enron , the program , the interview  process , as well as a chance for students to meet and chat with enron reps .  since this is the first year that we are recruiting from cal berkeley , i  think that it is important that i attend this event on campus so that i can  answer any interview process questions . i will check the schedule and see if  it is possible to move the presentation to the 23 rd . the only negative is  that i will not be able to attend because i will be conducting interviews at  rice that day . also , it is very difficult to find a location to hold the  presentation , and i need to check on location availability on the 23 rd .  however , i do think that we should take advantage of the seminar on campus .  this may mean that they are two seperate trips to campus . perhaps , we can  also set up some other presentations for the 23 rd or even the monday prior .  although i would like to be able to attend the class / seminar presentations , i  don ' t think that it is as vital as the general presentation .  what are your thoughts ?

    <br>
    <br>
    We are contacting you to remind you that on 5 July 2006 our Account Review 
    Team identified some unusual activity in your account. In accordance with 
    PayPal's User Agreement and to ensure that your account has not been 
    compromised, access to your account was limited. Your account access will 
    remain limited until this issue has been resolved.<br>
    <br>
    To secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may require some 
    additional information from you for the following reason:<br>
    <br>
    We have been notified that a card associated with your account has been 
    reported as lost or stolen, or that there were additional problems with your 
    card.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    This process is mandatory, and if not completed within the nearest time your 
    account or credit card may be subject for temporary suspension. <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    We encourage you to log in and perform the steps necessary to restore your 
    account access as soon as possible. Allowing your account access to remain 
    limited for an extended period of time may result in further limitations on 
    the use of your account and possible account closure.<br>

width=""1"" border=""0"">paypal is committed to maintaining a safe environment for 
    its community of customers. to protect the security of your account, paypal 
    employs some of the most advanced security systems in the world and our 
    anti-fraud teams regularly screen the paypal system for unusual activity.
    
    
    we are contacting you to remind you that on 5 july 2006 our account review 
    team identified some unusual activity in your account. in accordance with 
    paypal's user agreement and to ensure that your account has not been 
    compromised, access to your account was limited. your account access will 
    remain limited until this issue has been resolved.
    
    to secure your account and quickly restore full access, we may require some 
    additional information from you for the following reason:
    
    we have been notified that a card associated with your account has been 
    reported as lost or stolen, or that there were additional problems with your 
    card.
    
    
    this process is mandatory, and if not completed within the nearest time your 
    account or credit card may be subject for temporary suspension. 
    
    to securely confirm your paypal information please click on the link bellow:
    
    
    
    https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_login-run
    
    
    
    we encourage you to log in and perform the steps necessary to restore your 
    account access as soon as possible. allowing your account access to remain 
    limited for an extended period of time may result in further limitations on 
    the use of your account and possible account closure.
    
    for more information about how to protect your account please visit paypal 
    security center. we apologize for any incovenience this may cause, and we 
    apriciate your assistance in helping us to maintain the integrity of the 
    entire paypal system.
    
    
    
    thank you for using paypal!

          therefore, 
            as prevention measure, we have temporarely limited access to sensitive 
            paypal account features.we encourage customers to get their information 
            up-to-date and change password often.

            has assigned you an unique tracking number.

            please review your information after loging in. use only your 
            assigned unique url.
            click this button to access your unique url (! please read below 
            for security tips) and gain full access: 
            
            
               
                
                (

        to safely and securely access the paypal website or your account, open

        paypal url (https://www.paypal.com/us/) to be sure you are on the real
        paypal site.
        
        paypal will never ask you to enter your password in an email.

                              Administration (NCUA) is the independent federal 
                              agency that charters and supervises federal credit 
                              unions. NCUA, backed of the full faith and credit 
                              of the U.S. government, operates the National 
                              Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) 
                              insuring the savings of 80 million account holders 
                              in all federal credit unions and many 
                              state-chartered credit unions. During the 1990s
